## 🔴 Missing Features (Critical Gaps)

### **Major Missing Pages**
- ❌ **End User Management** (`/users`) - Complete page placeholder ("Coming soon...")
- ❌ **Analytics Dashboard** (`/analytics`) - No charts, metrics visualization, or reporting
- ❌ **Settings Management** (`/settings`) - System-wide configuration missing

### **Incomplete Implementations**
- ⚠️ **Admin Management** - UI complete but uses mock data, no real API integration
- ⚠️ **Billing Integration** - Shows status but missing Stripe portal, plan upgrades
- ⚠️ **Usage Dashboard** - Missing historical trends charts and detailed analytics

### **API Integration Issues**
- ⚠️ **Mixed API Patterns** - Some components use typed API client, others use generic calls
- ⚠️ **Pagination Handling** - Inconsistent meta data structure handling
- ⚠️ **Error Boundaries** - Missing global error handling for unexpected failures

## ⚡ Immediate Issues Fixed

### **JavaScript Errors (Resolved)**
- ✅ **Pagination Error** - Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'pages')`
  - **Solution**: Updated verifications page to use proper API client method with safe pagination handling
  
- ✅ **Array Length Error** - Fixed `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`  
  - **Solution**: Added null checks and safe array operations throughout verifications components

- ✅ **API Integration** - Replaced generic API calls with typed methods
  - **Solution**: Used `apiClient.listVerifications()` instead of direct HTTP calls

## 📋 Production Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Critical Features (Must-Have) - 2-3 weeks**

#### **1. End User Management** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Location**: `/src/pages/Users.tsx` (currently placeholder)

  - User status management (active/suspended)
  - Export user data (GDPR compliance)
  - Bulk operations (select multiple users)

#### **2. Complete API Integration** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: Mixed use of typed vs generic API calls
- **Tasks**:
  - Replace all generic `apiClient.get/post/patch` with typed methods
  - Ensure consistent error handling across all API calls
  - Fix remaining pagination meta structure issues
  - Add loading states for all async operations

#### **3. Settings Management** 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Location**: `/src/pages/Settings.tsx` (currently placeholder)  
- **Requirements**:
  - System-wide configuration interface
  - Security settings (password policies, session timeout)
  - Notification preferences
  - Application-level toggles and features
  - Integration settings (webhooks, API limits)

### **Phase 2: Essential Features (Should-Have) - 2 weeks**

#### **1. Admin Management Backend Integration**
- **Location**: `/src/components/organization/AdminManagement.tsx`

- **Tasks**:
  - Replace mock data with real API calls
  - Implement invite/remove admin functionality
  - Add role and permissions management
  - Email invitations for new admins

#### **2. Analytics Dashboard** 
- **Location**: `/src/pages/Analytics.tsx` (currently placeholder)

  - Session timeout handling
  - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
  - Rate limiting indicators

### **Phase 3: Polish & Enhancement (Nice-to-Have) - 1-2 weeks**

#### **1. Complete Billing Integration**
- **Current State**: Shows billing status, missing interactions
- **Requirements**:
  - Stripe billing portal integration
  - Plan upgrade/downgrade flows
  - Usage-based billing displays
  - Payment method management
  - Invoice history and downloads

#### **2. Real-time Features**
- **Tasks**:
  - WebSocket connections for live dashboard updates
  - Real-time notification system
  - Auto-refresh for metrics and verifications

## 🎯 Current Deployment Status

### **What Works in Production**
- ✅ Login and authentication flow
- ✅ Dashboard with real-time statistics  
- ✅ Verifications management (after recent fixes)

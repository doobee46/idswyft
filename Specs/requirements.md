Requirement 1: User Identity Verification via Document and Optional Selfie

User Story: As a platform user, I want to securely upload my government-issued ID and optionally a selfie so that my identity can be verified quickly and accurately for platform access.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a user uploads a document THEN the system SHALL accept JPEG, PNG, or PDF formats.

WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL perform OCR extraction using Tesseract to capture key fields.

WHEN OCR extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (name, date of birth, document number, expiration date).

WHEN a document passes basic validation THEN the system SHALL check image quality and authenticity using OpenCV.

IF a document fails authenticity checks THEN the system SHALL mark verification as pending review and optionally trigger paid API verification.

WHEN a user uploads a selfie THEN the system SHALL compare the selfie to the document photo using face recognition.

IF face recognition matches THEN the system SHALL mark verification as successful.

IF face recognition does not match THEN the system SHALL mark verification as failed and provide guidance for re-upload.

WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL store the result securely and return a status via API/webhook.

WHEN a developer queries verification status THEN the system SHALL return one of the following states: pending, verified, failed, or manual review required.

Requirement 2: Developer API Key Management

User Story: As a developer, I want to generate and manage API keys so that I can securely integrate the verification system into my applications.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a developer signs up THEN the system SHALL provide a unique API key.

WHEN a developer regenerates an API key THEN the old key SHALL be invalidated.

WHEN using the API key THEN all requests SHALL be authenticated.

WHEN an API key is compromised THEN the system SHALL allow immediate revocation.

Requirement 3: Webhook Notifications

User Story: As a developer, I want to receive real-time notifications of verification status changes via webhook so that I can update my app without polling.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a verification completes THEN the system SHALL send a webhook to the registered URL.

WHEN webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times.

WHEN webhook is sent THEN the payload SHALL include user_id, verification status, and timestamp.

Requirement 4: Minimal Admin Dashboard

User Story: As an admin, I want a dashboard to view verification requests so that I can monitor system activity and handle manual reviews.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all users with verification status.

WHEN filtering by status THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by pending, verified, or failed.

WHEN a manual review is needed THEN the system SHALL allow the admin to approve or reject verification.

Requirement 5: Optional Paid API Fallback

User Story: As a platform user, I want optional verification via paid APIs (Persona/Onfido) for high-risk or failed checks so that verification is reliable.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a document fails local verification THEN the system SHALL trigger optional paid API verification.

WHEN the paid API returns a result THEN the system SHALL update the verification status accordingly.

Requirement 6: Secure File Storage

User Story: As a platform user, I want my uploaded documents and selfies to be stored securely so that my personal information is protected.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL encrypt them at rest.

WHEN files are accessed THEN the system SHALL serve them over HTTPS only.

WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL retain files according to retention policy.

Requirement 7: Compliance with Privacy Regulations

User Story: As a platform operator, I want the system to comply with GDPR and CCPA so that user data is handled lawfully.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN storing personal data THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive fields.

WHEN a user requests deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all personal data and uploaded files.

WHEN a user requests access THEN the system SHALL provide all stored information in a readable format.

Requirement 8: Verification Status Query

User Story: As a developer, I want to query the verification status of a user via API so that my app can respond appropriately.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN querying /verify/status/:user_id THEN the system SHALL return the latest status.

WHEN no verification exists THEN the system SHALL return a clear “not verified” response.

Requirement 9: Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection

User Story: As a platform operator, I want to limit verification requests per user and per developer so that the system is protected from abuse.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN a user exceeds X verification attempts per day THEN the system SHALL block additional requests.

WHEN a developer exceeds Y API calls per hour THEN the system SHALL throttle requests.

WHEN a request is blocked THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error message.

Requirement 10: Developer Sandbox Environment

User Story: As a developer, I want a sandbox environment so that I can test integration without affecting production data or incurring costs.

Acceptance Criteria

WHEN using the sandbox THEN the system SHALL provide test API keys.

WHEN uploading documents in sandbox THEN the system SHALL simulate verification without real API calls.

WHEN testing webhooks THEN the system SHALL allow configurable endpoints for developers.

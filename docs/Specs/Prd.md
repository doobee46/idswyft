Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Name: TBD
Purpose: Provide a developer-friendly, user-friendly identity verification platform that is open-source, minimal, and easy to integrate.

Objectives

Allow developers to integrate verification APIs quickly.

Provide end-users a seamless verification experience.

Offer a free, open-source solution with minimal complexity.

Enable MVP launch with minimal upfront cost.

Target Users

Primary: Developers needing identity verification APIs for apps and platforms.

Secondary: End-users verifying identity documents.

Key Features
1. Developer Integration

RESTful API for identity verification.

Simple SDKs for major languages (Node.js, Python, PHP).

Webhooks for verification status updates.

Minimal documentation and example code snippets.

2. User Verification Flow

Upload ID documents (passport, driver’s license, national ID).

Optional selfie or liveness check.

Document text extraction via Tesseract OCR.

Basic authenticity checks using OpenCV (image tampering, quality).

Optional face recognition to match ID photo with selfie.

Verification result delivered via API/webhook.

3. Admin / Dashboard

Minimal dashboard showing verification status.

Search and filter verified users.

Export verification data for compliance or reporting.

4. Security & Compliance

End-to-end encryption of user data.

GDPR and CCPA compliance for personal data.

Role-based access control for dashboard.

5. Open-Source & Cost

Hosted on GitHub under an open-source license.

Free for developers to integrate.

Minimal dependencies to reduce maintenance overhead.

6. Optional Paid API Integration

Integrate Persona / Onfido sandbox for high-risk or failed checks.

Reduces costs while maintaining accuracy for critical verifications.

Technical Requirements

Backend: Node.js / Python

Database: PostgreSQL or SQLite

File storage: Local or S3-compatible storage

Cloud-ready architecture for self-hosting or deployment

Metrics / Success Criteria

Integration time: <30 minutes for developers.

Verification accuracy: >90% document validation for minimal solution.

User experience: <3 steps to complete verification.

Adoption: Target at least 50 active developers in first 3 months.

Risks & Mitigation

Security risk: Encrypt stored documents and personal data.

Fraud risk: Optional paid API for higher-risk cases.

Developer adoption: Provide simple SDKs, example projects, and sandbox environment.


Acceptance Table – Identity Verification MVP
Req #	Requirement	Workflow Step	Related MVP Component	Notes / Acceptance Criteria
1	User Identity Verification via Document and Optional Selfie	Document upload → OCR → Image checks → Optional selfie match → Verification result	Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, face_recognition, webhook/API	AC 1–10: file format, OCR extraction, validation, face match, verification states
2	Developer API Key Management	Developer signup → API key creation → Authenticated API calls	API key generation and authentication	AC 1–4: key creation, regeneration, revocation, authentication
3	Webhook Notifications	Verification completion → Webhook call → Retry if failed	Webhook module, event triggers	AC 1–3: real-time notifications, retry, payload content
4	Minimal Admin Dashboard	Admin login → View verification requests → Manual review	Admin dashboard	AC 1–3: filtering, sorting, approve/reject manual review
5	Optional Paid API Fallback	Document fails local checks → Trigger paid API → Update verification	Persona / Onfido integration	AC 1–2: conditional API call, update status
6	Secure File Storage	Upload → Encrypted storage → HTTPS access → Retention policy	Storage module (S3 / local)	AC 1–3: encryption at rest, secure serving, retention handling
7	Compliance with Privacy Regulations	Store personal data → Handle user requests for deletion or access	Backend + database	AC 1–3: encryption, data deletion, access upon request
8	Verification Status Query	Developer calls /verify/status/:user_id → Return latest status	API endpoint	AC 1–2: status return, clear response if not verified
9	Rate Limiting and Abuse Protection	User / developer submits requests → System checks limits → Block or throttle if exceeded	API middleware	AC 1–3: limit per user/dev, block excess, return error message
10	Developer Sandbox Environment	Developer tests API calls → Upload test documents → Webhook simulation	Sandbox environment	AC 1–3: test API keys, simulated verification, configurable webhook endpoints
